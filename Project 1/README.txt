To run the program:

./main.py

The data table (datatable.csv) is formatted with column headers to show the runtime. M
corresponds to the row of the CSV file, but N was chosen randomly (to account for random
error, 100 trials per M value were used). The GCD is not shown. Time and space efficiency
are discussed in 'Project 1 Report.pdf'
